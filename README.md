# WGPU Compute->Render template

This is a template repository because I always find myself needing the same
kind of setup for my uni projects.

It is a simple renderer using compute shaders. Basically consists of a compute
pipeline that draws to a texture, and a quick render pipeline that draws that
texture to the screen using a quad.
